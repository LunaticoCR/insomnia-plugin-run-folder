# insomnia-plugin-run-folder
This plugin adds an option to each folder's drop-down menu so that all requests within can be ran at once.

The original code was taken from https://support.insomnia.rest/article/26-plugins#folder-actions and the author is [Greg Schier](https://github.com/gschier), creator of insomnia.rest, so all credits to him! All I did was create a repository, package it up and publish to npm.

To use this plugin you can install it from your [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest/) client by going into Preferences -> Plugins and entering the package name ```insomnia-plugin-run-folder``` then click "Install Plugin".
