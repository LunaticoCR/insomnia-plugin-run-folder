# insomnia-plugin-run-folder
This plugin adds an option to each folder's drop-down menu so that all requests within can be ran automatically in order.

The original code was taken from https://support.insomnia.rest/article/26-plugins#folder-actions and the author is [Greg Schier](https://github.com/gschier), creator of insomnia.rest, so all credits to him! All I did was create a repository, beatify the content of the modal window, package it up and publish to npm. So far anyway, I might modify or add more functionality if I see a need for it.

This plugin is published in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insomnia-plugin-run-folder). To use it you can install it from your [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest/) client by going into **Preferences -> Plugins** and entering the package name ```insomnia-plugin-run-folder``` then click "Install Plugin".
